## 1. Motivation
## 2. Goal  
Construction of a Python package that includes several methods for multi-output regression. The Framework will be shipped via pip, it will contain a front-end application for ease of use. The Methods include Single Target Methods, Multi-Output Regression Tree, at least two types of Neuronal Networks and an implementation of a Multi-Output Support Vector Regression Method. The Code shall *largely* be finished before Christmas. The Thesis shall be finished two weeks before due date.  

*Mention Focus on Software Development*

## 3. Current Status 
### Overview of Project structure  


### Methods  
#### Single Target Methods  
* Formulation of Method 
* List of currently supported Estimators 

#### Regression Trees 
#### Neuronal Nets  
* Structure of the Nets 
* Any Formalities? https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/graph-visualization/1558/2
#### Multi-Output Least Squares Supprt Vector Regression 
* Problems, Ideas for improvement(Dask. NumExpr, NP.Memmap) 

### Datasets 
* Table of Current/Planned Datasets and their Structure 

## 4. Presentation/Dash Prototype 
* If already developed a short interactive presentation of the current status 
* Otherwise Mockups of UI and a Test in Terminal
