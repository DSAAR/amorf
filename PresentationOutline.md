## 1. Goal  
Construction of a Python package that includes several methods for multi-output regression. The Framework will be shipped via pip, it will contain a front-end application for ease of use. The Methods include Single Target Methods, Multi-Output Regression Tree, at least two types of Neuronal Networks and an implementation of a Multi-Output Support Vector Regression Method. The Code shall *largely* be finished before Christmas. The Thesis shall be finished two weeks before due date.  

*Mention Focus on Software Development*
